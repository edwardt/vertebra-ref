The autoconf system currently creates a vertebra.pdf document that describes
the overall design of Vertebra.  This document is built using TeX and a few
support utilities for the figures (most notably GraphViz).  OmniGraffle source
is included for some manually produced figures.  This manual is not yet
considered comprehensive, nor complete, nor final.

To build the TeX docs on MacOS, use MacPorts.  Everything I needed was there.
Try the following packages (note the variants!):

* texlive_base +no_x11 (X11 never seems to build for me)
* texlive +letter (to set the system page size to US Letter)
* graphviz (for figures)

To build the TeX docs on Linux, you'll need some packages.  So far, I've tried
with Debian lenny.  I needed the following packages and their dependencies:

* texlive-latex-recommended (for pdflatex and other basics)
* texlive-latex-extra (for nomencl.sty)
* texlive-latex-fonts-recommended (for pzdr font used by hyperref.sty)
* ghostscript (for ps2pdf, since graphviz doesn't support PDF here)

There is also an html directory containing some stand-alone documentation that
is better illustrated outside of the TeX sources.

The src directory contains various utilities written to specifically generate
documentation.
