The autoconf system currently creates a vertebra.pdf document that describes
the overall design of Vertebra.  This document is built using TeX and a few
support utilities for the figures (most notably GraphViz).  OmniGraffle source
is included for some manually produced figures.  This manual is not yet
considered comprehensive, nor complete, nor final.

There is also an html directory containing some stand-alone documentation that
is better illustrated outside of the TeX sources.

The src directory contains various utilities written to specifically generate
documentation.
